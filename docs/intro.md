# What is Magic?
Magic is a network of networks â€” seamlessly blending coverage across WiFi, Cellular, and new technologies like 5G and LPWAN. 

**Providing Coverage**

Anyone can extend the availability of Magic-enabled networks by providing an access point of their own. This can be accomplished purely through software and off-the-shelf hardware by installing the agent on a computer or mobile phone, or through more involved means such as custom router configurations, open-source router construction, or full-scale integration into a backbone provider. 

**Using the Network**

Just like running a VPN client or hotspot, a Magic Network consumer runs a Magic client on a device to automatically broker access to Magic- enabled access points. The Magic client acts on behalf of the consumer, and interacts with the global Magic supernetwork to authorize access to in-range Wi-Fi access points, cellular base stations, and more. The Magic client also provides wallet functionality, as well as support for sponsorship of connectivity by other Magic users for fully-autonomous and fleet applications.
