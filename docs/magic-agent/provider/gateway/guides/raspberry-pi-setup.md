# Using a Raspberry Pi as a Gateway

For this tutorial, weâ€™ve dedicated a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to serve as a gateway.

If you already have a Pi setup that is connected to an existing internet connection, simply follow the instructions below to install Magic Agent on the Pi.

## Raspberry Pi Pre-requisites

- Running Raspbian (Lite is sufficient)
- Connected to the internet

Note: The Pi should be connected to the internet on the same network as you are planning to install Magic and needs to maintain internet connectivity in order to serve as a gateway for Magic Clients to connect through.

## Install Magic Pre-requisites

#### Update

Some packages may fail to resolve if you don't first update Raspbian

```sudo apt update```

#### Install git

```sudo apt install git```

#### Install pip

```sudo apt install python-pip```

#### Install Docker

```curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh```

#### Add user to Docker group

Running the docker install script will tell you to add the user to the docker group by running

```sudo usermod -aG docker pi```

Not doing this will make attaching to the Docker daemon fail later on in the setup process

#### Install Docker Compose

As of 5/14/2019 installing docker-compose through pip will fail giving the following error: `TypeError: unsupported operand types for -=: 'Retry' and 'int'`

Currently you have to first install an old version using `apt`

```sudo apt install docker-compose```

and then upgrade to a newer version, but not the newest version, since that also fails to install due to https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6617

```sudo pip install docker-compose==1.23.2```

#### Reboot

You won't be able to connect to the Docker daemon until you restart

```sudo reboot```

## Install Magic

Follow the same steps as the Quick Start:
https://magic-network.github.io/magic-agent/provider/gateway/quick-start/gateway-server-setup.html

Depending on permissions on the Pi, you may need to modify the steps above with sudo.

## Run Magic on startup

There are various ways of running a program on startup so if there is a method you prefer please feel free to use that method instead. 

Our default recommended method is to edit the `rc.local` file since we only want to have the program run once.

In the terminal type in:

```sudo nano /etc/rc.local```

Now add the line:

```docker-compose -f <location of magic agent>/docker-compose.yml up -d```

Assuming you installed the magic agent to the default location the path will be:

```/home/pi/magic-agent/docker-compose.yml```

To save your changes hit ctrl-x and it will prompt you to save your changes. Enter y/yes and you should be good to go. If you want, try rebooting the pi and once it has finished booting run `docker ps` in the terminal to see if the container is running. It should appear in the list of running containers.
