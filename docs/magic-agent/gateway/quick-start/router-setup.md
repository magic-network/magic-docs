# Configure Router/AP:

At a high level, this is what you'll need to configure:

1. Set router to WPA2-Enterprise, setting your gateway device's IP as the gateway server. 
1. Set hostname of gateway:
    - Via a DNS entry on your router. (recommended)
    - Via manually changing hostname on your gateway device.
1. Verify gateway server is configured with the IP of the router.
