# Magic Coin

Magic's payment/accounting system is built on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) smart contracts, 
one of which defines the Magic Coin (MGC), an [ERC-20 standard](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) token.
Each and every user and/or provider of Magic will be able to buy, sell, use, and earn these tokens freely in a completely
distributed manner.
